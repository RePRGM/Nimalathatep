# Nimalathatep
Nimalathatep is a Nim shellcode payload generation project that aims to get a stealthy binary into your hands quickly. All methods use well-known API-call sequences.

# Evasion
AV/EDR avoidance is performed through AES encryption followed by Base64, with the payload itself only being decrypted at runtime. The IV is currently static, but I aim to change this in the future. Compiling to a control panel item is your stealthiest approach for now. 

# Compilation
Ensure you have NIM downloaded from here: https://nim-lang.org/install.html </br>
</br>

Install the winim, ptr_math, and nim crypto prior to compiling with the following commands:</br>
```nimble install winim```</br>
```nimble install nimcrypto```</br>
```nimble install ptr_math``` </br>
```nimble install sysrandom``` </br>
To compile: </br>
```nim -d:release c .\nimalathatep.nim``` </br>

# Usage
Run the executable and give it the desired API method, shellcode file, and output file type: </br> </br>
```.\nimalathatep.exe <apiMethod> <binFile> <outfiletype>``` </br>

# Changes
-Added support for all API calls to be used as an XLL <br>
-Added random key for encryption <br>
-Formatting fixes <br>
-Added new API method (EnumCalendarInfo) <br>

# To Do
